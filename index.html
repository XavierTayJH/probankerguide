                <p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></i>  market interest rates, <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down"></i> average DDC balances</p>
                <h4>Maturity</h4>
                <p>Demand deposit balances may be withdrawn at any time without advance notice or penalty, but customers tend to keep <b>positive</b> DD balances even when market interest rates are very high.</p>
                <p>You may specify what proportion of your retail and corporate DD operating costs to collect from customers in the form of fees charged.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>Given that,<br />Annual retail DD operating costs = 3% of balances </p>
                <p>And you set <br />Fees = 66% (entered as "0.66") </p>
                <p>Your net cost of maintaining retail demand balances would be:<br /> Net cost (per year) = 3%*(1-0.66) = 1%</p>
                <p>If you charged fees of "160", you would more than recover your cost of providing DD services. With this fee, you would be making a <b>profit of 1.8% per year</b> on your DD balances.</p>
                <p><b>So, why not just set high fees?</b></p>
                <p>Because high fees are equivalent to <b>"paying negative interest"</b>, which <b>reduces the attractiveness</b> of your deposit accounts.</p>
                <h3>Deposits</h3>
                <p>Each quarter, you choose a separate interest rate and advertising budget for each of these accounts. New balances earn this new rate, while the rates paid in past periods continue to apply to older deposits.</p>
                <p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></i> deposit rate/advertising,<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></i> no. of customers maintaining an account at your bank.</p>
                <p><b>Stronger customer relationships make account balances less sensitive to short-run changes</b> in account pricing, and therefore correspond to lower adjustment speeds. Generally, smaller accounts and those with shorter maturities are less price-sensitive. For example, customer relationship effects are more important for savings accounts than for fixed deposits or corporate loans.</p>
                <h3>Savings Account Deposits</h3>
                <p>No explicit maturity</p>
                <h3>Fixed deposits</h3>
                <p>8-period maturity</p>
                <p>Implicit interest and reputation effects are moderate</p>
                <h3>Certificate of deposits (CD)</h3>
                <p>Your bank may issue large CD obligations to obtain loanable funds. Usually, you may issue whatever volume of new CDs you wish, in each of three maturity categories: one, two, or four quarters. </p>
                <p>The cost of CD funds depends on your firm's leverage: banks with relatively low leverage can issue CDs at the (riskless) treasury rate for bonds with the same maturity. As your bank's leverage increases beyond some threshold level, however, your required CD rate also rises.</p>
                <p>The market may ration your CD issues if you have very high leverage.</p>

(The Economic Environment Report describes required reserve ratios, which can change over the course of your simulation.) The dollar volume of Required Reserves cannot be known exactly when you are making your decisions, because it depends on your realized deposit balances. Players should estimate their deposit balances, and choose an Initial Reserve Allocation sufficient to satisfy anticipated reserve requirements. If your bank turns out to need reserves in excess of your Initial Reserve Allocation, ProBanker will automatically reduce Federal Funds sold (FFS) or borrow at the Discount Window. Any funds transferred from the latter sources to fulfill RR are assessed a proportional transaction cost of 0.5% (Note: this cost is not an annualized rate and your instructor may choose to increase the cost).

Although U.S. banks may not (by law) pay explicit interest on these balances, they will perform free services in proportion to the balances you hold with them. These free services frequently relate to check clearing, and hence lower the cost of servicing your demand deposit customers. ER balances earn implicit interest at a rate equal to about 90% (more precisely, 1.0 minus the DDC reserve requirement) of the period's average risk-free federal funds rate. (This rate of implicit compensation for interbank demand balances assumes perfect competition for such balances.) If implicit interest earned exceeds noninterest DD operating costs, the excess is lost to the bank. ER balances incur no transaction costs.

                      The CEO can borrow from other banks and financial institutions through the overnight Federal Funds

                      A sound bank will pay a rate on FFP that is equal to that earned on FFS. However, as a bank's

                      The default setting does not allow banks to pay explicit interest on any type of demand deposit account.
                      However, ProBanker permits your Administrator to set positive interest rate ceilings on either type of
                      demand deposit--so check your Regulatory Environment Report to see what regulations apply to your
                      simulations.
                      In addition to the possibility of explicit interest payments, ProBanker banks compete for demand deposit by
                      paying implicit interest in two forms. First, you can direct advertising expenditures to either type of DD
                      account. Second, you can vary the level of your checking-related fees to make your DD accounts more
                      or less attractive. Lower fees elicit greater DD account balances, but your noninterest revenue will also
                      be lower. Setting the fee rate above 100% makes DD services a profitable activity, but it reduces your
                      available "interest free" DD balances.
                      Both types of DD balances are positively related to the effective rate paid on them, negatively related to the
                      level of market interest rates, and positively related to the level of GDP. DDC are more interest-elastic than
                      DDR. Demand deposit accounts have substantial customer relationship effects, especially among retail
                      customers. DDC balances differ from DDR in two additional ways:
                       DDC balances increase with the volume of corporate loans outstanding, reflecting the
                      compensating balance arrangements that often accompany FR and FL.
                       DDC balances fall when the bank's leverage increases beyond some critical level, as
                      customers fear that they will lose their uninsured funds if the bank fails. (See Section 4.8).

                    <p>A security is said to trade in a "perfect market" when individual buyers and sellers can trade large quantities without having a noticeable effect on the security's price. Perfect- market securities must be available in large supply, and have very low default risk -- or at least have default probabilities that are widely understood. A financial institution will buy and sell perfect market securities to fill gaps in its balance sheet, or as a means of speculating on interest rate changes. ProBanker's Quantity-Set assets and liabilities trade in perfect markets.</p>

                    <h2>Federal Funds</h2><hr />
                    <p>Fed funds are short-term (usually overnight), unsecured loans between banks. Sellers (lenders) use Fed funds as a marginal interest-earning investment. Fed fund purchasers (borrowers) use this source of funds to finance their asset portfolios. A lender of Federal Funds carries an asset item called Federal Funds Sold. The borrower shows a liability item, Federal Funds Purchased.</p>

                    <h2>Advertising</h2><hr />
                    <p>You may wonder why a bank would prefer to attract customers with advertising instead of simply paying a higher deposit rate or cutting its contract loan rate. The situation for banks is not unusual: why does Domino's Pizza advertise, instead of trying to attract customers with just a low price? In ProBanker, there are two reasons to advertise. </p>
                    <p>First, banks were historically limited (by Regulation Q) in their ability to pay market rates on some types of deposits. In place of explicit interest, they competed by offering convenient offices and long banking hours, free gifts, etc. In the United States, Reg Q was mostly eliminated by 1986. Now only demand deposits (may) retain a deposit rate ceiling.</p>
                    <p>Second, banks advertise because some implicit compensation may be more valuable to customers than the same expenditure on explicit interest. In ProBanker, customers always respond to higher advertising expenditures, although at a diminishing rate. For some types of accounts and over a limited range, advertising may be more highly valued than explicit interest (which is taxable to the recipient).</p>

                    <h2>Competition from Primary Market</h2><hr />
                    <p>Each bank's most direct competition comes from other banks in the same competitive Region. However, customers living in the Region are not required to bank with a local bank. Suppose all the bankers in a Region conspired to set their deposit rates very low. Some customers would shop for better rates in other geographic regions, or by looking for primary market investments like treasury bills or money market mutual funds. Borrowers would behave the same way. If Regional banks offered a good deal, they'd bank locally. But if all Regional loan rates were high, some potential borrowers would seek loans from distant banks or their suppliers. Others could issue commercial paper (at rates determined in the financial market), or liquidate some investments.</p>

                    <h2>Effective Rate of Interest</h2><hr />
                    <p>Customers consider more than just the posted interest rate when evaluating the attractiveness of a bank's loans and deposits. They compute an effective interest rate by combining the explicit interest rate, implicit benefits from advertising expenditures (gifts, etc.) and fees charged. Customers then compare effective rates across Regional competitors (and against open market alternatives) in order to pick the best deal.</p>

                    <h2>Marginal Cost of Deposits</h2><hr />
                    <p>The marginal cost of deposits is your cost of raising an additional dollar of deposit balances. The marginal cost has two components. First, it includes the rate that you pay to the "marginal" (that is, the additional) depositor. Second, since all depositors are paid the same rate, you must also account for the additional interest paid to your "infra-marginal" (that is, previous) depositors. The marginal cost of deposits is always at least as great as the deposit rate being paid.</p>

                    <h2>Loanable Funds</h2><hr />
                    <p>Loanable funds are the dollars you can lend when you issue more of some liability.</p>
                    <p>Suppose that the reserve requirement on a particular deposit type is k, meaning that the bank must hold cash assets equal to a fraction k of its deposit balances. The bank may lend only (1-k) dollars out of each deposit dollar, even though it must pay interest on the full deposit dollar. That is, "loanable funds" (LF) equal only a fraction of deposits:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>LF = (1-k)D</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>(Loanable funds are the dollars a bank can use to purchase productive assets, after setting aside its required cash reserves.) The cost of loanable funds is then given by:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>RLF = Rd/(1-k)</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, we reiterate and demonstrate the proper way to combine operating costs, advertising, and reserve requirements in computing the full cost of various deposit accounts.</p>

                    <h2>Marginal Revenue</h2><hr />
                    <p>The marginal revenue from a particular type of loan is the total interest revenue gained by making an additional, one-dollar loan. The marginal revenue has two components. First, it includes the interest you receive from the "marginal" borrower. Second, since all borrowers are charged the same loan rate, you must also take into account the lower interest payments that you will receive from your "infra-marginal" borrowers. The marginal revenue on loans can never be greater than the loan rate being charged.</p>

                    <h2>Maturity of a demand deposit</h2><hr />
                    <p>Demand deposit balances may be withdrawn at any time without advance notice or penalty, but customers tend to keep positive DD balances even when market interest rates are very high. The effective maturity of these DD balances depends upon how much (and how quickly) depositors adjust their average account balances in response to market interest rate changes. If depositors never adjusted - that is, if they kept the same account balance regardless of interest rate levels - DD would be a perpetual, fixed-rate liability for the issuing bank. More realistically, average DD balances tend to move inversely with market interest rates. When market rates rise, the bank loses some DD balances.</p>

                    <h2>The Basel (Basle) Capital Standards</h2><hr />
                    <p>Prior to 1988, each country imposed its own set of capital-adequacy requirements on its banks. Problems arose because many banks were operating across national boundaries, and different countries required different levels of capital for the same assets. Bankers therefore tended to shuffle some of their assets between different subsidiaries in different countries, to generate the lowest overall capital requirement. In response to this situation, about a dozen central banks began meeting under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (which is located in Basel, Switzerland) to design a common set of capital standards for major banks. The first set of capital standards was completed in July 1988, and involved only the bank's credit (default) risk exposures. Banks had to set aside 8% of risk adjusted assets of which 4% has to be in Tier I capital consisting mainly of equity instruments. U.S. regulators fully implemented those risk-based standards by the end of 1992.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Subsequent Basel discussions have sought to incorporate banking firms' interest rate and market risk exposures into risk-based capital requirements. In August of 1995, U.S. regulators announced that they would henceforth consider a bank's interest rate risk exposure when determining its "adequate" level of capital. The banking agencies have incorporated "market risk" into their formal risk-based capital standards, but only for very large institutions. Effective January 1, 1998, any bank or banking holding company whose trading activities exceed the smaller of $1 billion or 10% of the institution's total assets, had to hold capital to protect against losses in their foreign exchange, equity, interest-rate, or commodity trading books. The amount of this capital can be specified by each bank’s own internal model of the largest loss it expects to incur (at the 99% confidence level). This capital will be added to the capital required to cover the institution's credit risk on traditional activities.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 2006, Basel II was adopted which added a more comprehensive approach requiring banks to satisfy three pillars. Pillar 1 mandated minimum capital for credit, market and operation risk using standardized or Internal Ratings-Based approach. Pillar II focused on supervision and internal processes to complement the adequacy of capital while Pillar III focused on disclosure and the importance of providing transparent information to the public. The financial crisis of 2008 highlighted major inadequacies in the minimum capital assessments and Basel III was proposed and adopted for implementation by 2019. Although it maintained the 8% overall capital, it increased the core Tier I ratios to 6% and added on two more requirements; a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a potential countercyclical capital buffer that could add another 2.5%. See www.bis.org for ongoing developments in worldwide capital adequacy regulation.</p>

                    <h2>Caution</h2><hr />
                    <p><b>1.</b> You may be tempted to try using Autosim to "check out" the effects of Competitive decisions. Don't bother. This technique fails to give representative results, because your "real" competitors are unlikely to behave the same way as Autosim's pre-programmed competitors do. So don't try to flip back and forth between Autosim and Competitive Games, hoping to learn what will happen in the Competitive environment from an Autosim simulation. Use Autosim to learn about ProBanker, then switch over to the Competitive environment permanently.</p>
                    <p><b>2.</b> If your bank becomes too highly levered, uninsured lenders (FFP, Negotiable CDs) demand a higher interest rate to cover perceived default risk. Very highly levered banks will be unable to obtain all the funds they request in these markets. </p>
                    <p><b>3.</b> ProBanker’s tax system is simpler than the current U.S. tax code. Specifically, ProBanker has no provision for tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks. This means that if your bank runs a loss, the income statement will show the associated taxes, but that entry does not influence your Net Income.</p>
                    <p><b>4.</b> The main theoretical ideas on how to apply two key concepts to your pricing decisions marginal deposit cost and marginal loan revenue are discussed in ProBanker Lesson on How to Maximize Bank Profits in Help. This material is more difficult than in the rest of Chapter 6, and your Administrator may not want you to spend time on it. Therefore, consider Section 6.5 optional, and don't approach it until you have learned to avoid the more basic obstacles to profitable operations.</p>
