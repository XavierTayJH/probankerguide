                                Banks must keep reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, in proportion to their outstanding deposit
                                liabilities. (The Economic Environment Report describes required reserve ratios, which can change over
                                the course of your simulation.) The dollar volume of Required Reserves cannot be known exactly when
                                you are making your decisions, because it depends on your realized deposit balances. Players should
                                estimate their deposit balances, and choose an Initial Reserve Allocation sufficient to satisfy anticipated
                                reserve requirements. If your bank turns out to need reserves in excess of your Initial Reserve Allocation,
                                ProBanker will automatically reduce Federal Funds sold (FFS) or borrow at the Discount Window. Any
                                funds transferred from the latter sources to fulfill RR are assessed a proportional transaction cost of 0.5%
                                (Note: this cost is not an annualized rate and your instructor may choose to increase the cost).

                                If your "Initial Reserve Allocation" exceeds the level of required reserves, the excess will be held as
                                deposits due from other banks. Although U.S. banks may not (by law) pay explicit interest on these
                                balances, they will perform free services in proportion to the balances you hold with them. These free
                                services frequently relate to check clearing, and hence lower the cost of servicing your demand deposit
                                customers. ER balances earn implicit interest at a rate equal to about 90% (more precisely, 1.0 minus
                                the DDC reserve requirement) of the period's average risk-free federal funds rate. (This rate of implicit
                                compensation for interbank demand balances assumes perfect competition for such balances.) If implicit
                                interest earned exceeds noninterest DD operating costs, the excess is lost to the bank. ER balances incur
                                no transaction costs.

                                market. FFS earn an expected return equal to the riskless 90-day CD rate, which is known for certain
                                when Bank decisions are made. However, the actual FFS rate will differ from the 90-day CD rate by a
                                random factor that reflects unanticipated money market developments during the quarter. (Because most
                                FFS lending has a very short maturity the average Fed Funds rate over the coming quarter cannot be known
                                when you are making your decisions.) Your bank's ultimate FFS position also may differ from what you
                                entered as an initial decision, because FFS balances play an important part in the process for balancing
                                each bank's balance sheet. (Section 4.11 below provides details.)

                                the average of the 90-day CD rate and the quarter's risk-free Federal Funds rate. A loan's SPREAD
                                stays constant throughout its life, although the actual interest rate varies with the floating rate loan base. FL

                                demand is inversely related to the average contract rate that customers expect to pay over the loan's two-
                                period life. (The expected FL contract rate is the average of this period's rate and the expected rate next

                                period, given the bank's SPREAD and the forward rate implied by the government bond term structure.)

                                no opportunity to purchase seasoned bonds.) The Economic Environment Report specifies the corporate

                                A sound bank will pay a rate on FFP that is equal to that earned on FFS. However, as a bank's

                                The default setting does not allow banks to pay explicit interest on any type of demand deposit account.
                                However, ProBanker permits your Administrator to set positive interest rate ceilings on either type of
                                demand deposit--so check your Regulatory Environment Report to see what regulations apply to your
                                simulations.
                                In addition to the possibility of explicit interest payments, ProBanker banks compete for demand deposit by
                                paying implicit interest in two forms. First, you can direct advertising expenditures to either type of DD
                                account. Second, you can vary the level of your checking-related fees to make your DD accounts more
                                or less attractive. Lower fees elicit greater DD account balances, but your noninterest revenue will also
                                be lower. Setting the fee rate above 100% makes DD services a profitable activity, but it reduces your
                                available "interest free" DD balances.
                                Both types of DD balances are positively related to the effective rate paid on them, negatively related to the
                                level of market interest rates, and positively related to the level of GDP. DDC are more interest-elastic than
                                DDR. Demand deposit accounts have substantial customer relationship effects, especially among retail
                                customers. DDC balances differ from DDR in two additional ways:
                                 DDC balances increase with the volume of corporate loans outstanding, reflecting the
                                compensating balance arrangements that often accompany FR and FL.
                                 DDC balances fall when the bank's leverage increases beyond some critical level, as
                                customers fear that they will lose their uninsured funds if the bank fails. (See Section 4.8).

                                Under normal circumstances CEOs may sell as many (or few) CDs as they desire, with initial maturities of
                                1, 2 or 4 quarters. In deciding how many CDs to issue, be careful to note that old CDs "age down" as time
                                passes: last period's 4-quarter CDs become this period's 3-quarter CDs, and so forth.
                                Riskless CD rates for the coming quarter equal the same-maturity government bond's yield, as reported
                                in ProBanker's end-of-quarter Bond Reports. However, a highly levered bank's actual cost of CD funds
                                may incorporate a default premium above the riskless rate. The market also refuses to purchase CDs at any
                                price once the bank's leverage has become sufficiently high. See Section 4.8.

                                the assets you have purchased. The bank pays interest at a rate above its rate on federal funds borrowed

                                the DWA's rate premium from information on your Full Balance Sheet Report: subtract the rate you paid on
